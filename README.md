## Overview

This was my first front end mentor coding challenge and was a lot of fun. I think there is definitely improvements that could be made to my code - especially since I used flexbox and don't have too much experience with this. I used a lot of margins for spacing so maybe there could be improvements here. But overall was a lot of fun to do.
